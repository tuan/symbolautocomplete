# Trigger Workspace Symbol Suggestions

This extension shows a list of workspace symbols that matches the current word. You can further search for the right symbol using VSCode basic list search functionality.

## Features

The main reason why I create this extension is because VSCode does not give me autosuggestions for symbols that are not exported or when I'm editting a comment.

## Extension Settings

You can assign a shortcut to command with this is `symbolautocomplete.triggerSuggest` to show the suggestions.
